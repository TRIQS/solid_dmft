When the latter component dominates the resulting phase is known as a charge disproportionated state which is also insulating. What is happening in the bottom right corner is that the J favors here charge disproportionation but the unit cell has a single site, therefore the system has trouble converging and oscillates between a high occupation and a low occupation state."
